"""Save a figure as PNG + PDF + SVG with transparent backgrounds.

The SVG is the web-facing format: a transparent background lets it sit
seamlessly on an HTML page (the page background shows through instead of an
opaque white rectangle). Text is kept as real ``<text>`` elements (not vector
outlines) so that, once the SVG is inlined into the blog page, labels render in
the page's webfont and follow the page theme — see ``utils.figure_theme`` and
the inline/scrub step in ``site/build.py``. PNG/PDF are kept for previews and
the paper, and are made transparent too so all three formats stay visually
consistent.
