"""Figure 9: composed VEP AUPRC trajectories across continuation lineages.

Three model lineages, each three training stages warm-started in sequence, are
*composed* into a single trajectory over cumulative training tokens:

  - m5.1  : 1·L uniform → 1.7·L uniform → 1.7.2·L +zoonomia (warm-started from the
            parent's FINAL, fully-cooled checkpoint — a fresh rewarmup with no
            overlapping tokens).
  - m1.2  : 5·L → 5.1·L → 5.1.1·L  (zoonomia uniform ⅕; a pre-cooldown chain).
  - m3.2  : 6·L → 6.1·L → 6.1.1·L  (zoonomia upstream-tilted; a pre-cooldown chain).

Composition rule (the whole point of this figure): a continuation that branched
BEFORE its parent's cooldown shares the parent's W&B step counter, so the parent's
post-branch evals (its own cooldown tail, trained on a path we did NOT take) would
double-count. We therefore keep a parent phase's evals only up to the child's fork,
i.e. up to the cumulative-token level the child inherited. A continuation from a
parent's FINAL checkpoint has no such overlap — the parent's whole run is on-path.
Both cases fall out of one operation: truncate each parent phase at its child's
inherited-token offset (`mixture_lineage.inherited_components`). This keeps the
token axis identical to the cumulative-token accounting in the Appendix mixture
tree (validated at build time for the finished m5.1 lineage).

Token accounting and the per-stage fork fractions live in `mixture_lineage`; the
per-eval step→token mapping uses the constant batch×seq = 2,097,152 tokens/step
shared by every v0.9 1B run. The secondary top axis shows the consolidated step
count (cumulative tokens ÷ tokens-per-step), i.e. total optimizer steps along the
composed path — which is NOT the leaf run's raw W&B `_step` whenever an earlier
phase reset its counter (e.g. the HF-reinit of `uniform_to_uniform_1`).

m1.2 / m3.2 are still in flight on preemptible VMs and may log no evals yet; the
leaf stage then simply contributes no points and the curve extends automatically
once they resume (re-run `src/data.py`).
