"""Appendix: cooldown effect on VEP/loss via the m1 & m3 continuation chains.

The two zoonomia pre_cooldown chains
(`m1 -> m1.1 -> m1.2 -> m1.3`, `m3 -> m3.1 -> m3.2 -> m3.3`) are a series of
overlapping runs that give a natural cooldown counterfactual. Every continuation
warm-starts from its parent *before* that parent's learning-rate cooldown and
keeps training at peak LR; the parent meanwhile finishes its own cooldown on a
path the child never took. So at each fork we can read three evals at matched
cumulative-token levels:

  - pre_cooldown   : the parent's eval AT the fork (the shared warm-start ckpt,
                     still at peak LR).
  - post_cooldown  : the parent's FINAL eval, after it cooled down.
  - continued_peak : the child's eval at the SAME cumulative-token level as the
                     parent's cooled end, reached by continuing at peak LR.

From these we form two deltas per metric:
  - delta_cooldown  = post_cooldown  - pre_cooldown   (effect of cooling down)
  - delta_continued = continued_peak - pre_cooldown   (effect of the same extra
                      tokens spent at peak LR instead of cooling)

Token alignment is exact, not interpolated: all v0.9 1B runs share one batch x
seq = 2,097,152 tokens/step, and a continuation keeps its parent's W&B `_step`
counter, so cumulative tokens = `_step * TOKENS_PER_STEP` across a whole chain
and matching on `_step` matches on cumulative tokens. The fork step, the parent's
cooled end, and the child's matched point all land on the 10%-cadence eval steps
(within <=1 step), so each value is read directly off a logged eval.

Caveat (flagged in the output): the forks step progressively earlier into each
parent (0.8 -> 0.6 -> 0.4 of the parent's own tokens), so the parent's cooldown
*tail* lengthens down the chain while each child's peak-LR runway does not. By the
LAST fork in each chain (`m1.2->m1.3`, `m3.2->m3.3`) the child is the terminal
leaf, which has itself begun cooling down before reaching the parent's final
token level. Its `continued_peak` point is therefore ~29% into the leaf's own
cooldown — not a pure peak-LR counterfactual — so those rows are flagged
`continued_partially_cooled=True`. The pre->post cooldown delta is unaffected.

VEP AUPRCs come from the committed `data/data_mixture_history.csv` (same source
as Figure 10); `eval/loss` is not in that CSV and is fetched live from W&B at the
same eval steps. Outputs (in `figures/appendix/`, with the other appendix results):
  - cooldown_effects.csv  : all 10 metrics x 6 forks (raw + deltas).
  - cooldown_effects.md   : summary for eval/loss and macro_avg.
