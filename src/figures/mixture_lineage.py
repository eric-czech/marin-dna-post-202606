"""Lineage, mixture weights, and token accounting for the v0.9 mixture sweep.

This information is not recoverable from W&B alone — it's transcribed from the
marin experiment (`experiments/dna/exp135_bolinas_mix_sweep.py`). Each run is one
training stage; continuations warm-start from a parent checkpoint.

Naming (the `name` field, used as the figure label and a stable handle):
  - Tree-path id: root number + sibling indices (`1`, `1.7`, `1.7.1`). Dot count
    = depth; the path = the branch. Roots are separate trees (1=unif, 2=upstream
    -only, 3=cds-only, 4=downstream-only, 5=zoo, 6=zoo upstream-tilted).
  - Trailing `·S/M/L` = the run's OWN new-portion token budget (from the W&B
    `tokens` tag), set by `max_train_examples` to a per-region dataset size:
        S ≈ 5.2B  (downstream-dataset-sized)
        M ≈ 17.5B (upstream-dataset-sized)
        L ≈ 62B   (cds-dataset-sized)
    The base `unif` root (`1·L`) is ~52B (3×upstream caps, not via
    max_train_examples) and is grouped with L.

Branch types and token accounting:
  - "root"         — trained from scratch; no inherited tokens.
  - "pre_cooldown" — warm-started from a parent checkpoint taken before the
                     parent's cooldown (~80% of the parent's run).
  - "final"        — warm-started from a parent's final (fully-cooled) checkpoint.
  Inherited tokens scale the PARENT's own tokens by `keep_fraction(run)` for a
  pre_cooldown branch (default COOLDOWN_KEEP_FRACTION = 0.8) and by 1.0 for
  final; grandparent-and-earlier contributions always pass through at 100% (they
  precede every branch point).
  Note: most pre_cooldown branches sit at exactly 0.8 of the parent (the marin
  `ResumeBeforeCooldown(cooldown_fraction=0.2)` branch point), so the flat 0.8 is
  used for them. The CHAINED zoonomia continuations fork progressively earlier than
  0.8 of their parent's own tokens — exp135-zoonomia-m{1,3}.2 at ~0.60 and the
  terminal m{1,3}.3 at ~0.40 — before the parent's own cooldown but short of 0.8,
  so they carry an explicit `keep_fraction` override. This keeps both the
  cumulative-token accounting (Appendix mixture tree) and the composed trajectory
  (Figure 10, which truncates each parent phase at its child's `keep_fraction`)
  faithful to the true fork point. One older pre_cooldown branch (1.7.1) actually
  sits at ~68% of its parent but is left at the flat 0.8 for back-compat with the
  published tree.

The lineages composed in Figure 10 (root -> leaf):
  - 1·L -> 1.7·L -> 1.7.2·L              (uniform -> uniform_to_uniform_1 -> m5.1;
                                          leaf warm-starts from the parent's FINAL ckpt)
  - 5·L -> 5.1·L -> 5.1.1·L -> 5.1.1.1·L (m1 -> m1.1 -> m1.2 -> m1.3; pre_cooldown chain)
  - 6·L -> 6.1·L -> 6.1.1·L -> 6.1.1.1·L (m3 -> m3.1 -> m3.2 -> m3.3; pre_cooldown chain)
The terminal m1.3 / m3.3 legs were originally tracked while they were still
running on preemptible VMs; downstream code still tolerates partial runs so the
figure can be refreshed during transient resume states.
