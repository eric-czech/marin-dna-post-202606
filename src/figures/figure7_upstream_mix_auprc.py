"""Figure 7: continued-pretraining mixture shift — composite VEP AUPRC vs upstream proportion.

Seven `uniform_to_upstream_*` continuations (all warm-started from the 1·L
uniform run) trained mixes from upstream-heavy (U90) down to no-upstream
(C50/D50). We plot each run's final composite 6-task VEP AUPRC against the
upstream proportion of its mix, with the 1·L uniform run's score as a dotted
reference line. The ⅓-mix continuations (uniform_to_upstream_3.7 / 1.6·M and
uniform_to_uniform_1 / 1.7·L) are omitted — they just repeat the uniform mixture.
